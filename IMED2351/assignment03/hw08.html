INSTRUCTIONS:

Conditionals

You are given 2 variables in each section below. Write the conditional if()...else() statement(s) that will compare the variables and display the following message(s)
a) if the variables are equal then display -- "The values are equal"
b) if the first variable is greater than the second variable -- "The first value is greater than the second"
c) if the first variable is less than the second variable -- "The first value is less than the second"

Use document.write() to display the messages

Upload to your web site when completed.  Place a link to this file from your student home page.

If you get stuck see an example here:  http://www.imed2351.com/javascript/hw-conditionals-sol.htm


BONUS:  Instead of using separate if() statements for each section, create a user-defined function and pass the values are arguments.
You can name the function compareValues() for example.
