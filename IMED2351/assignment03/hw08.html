INSTRUCTIONS:

Conditionals

You are given 2 variables in each section below. Write the conditional if()...else() statement(s) that will compare the variables and display the following message(s)
a) if the variables are equal then display "The values are equal"

b) if the first variable is greater than the second variable "The first value is greater than the second"
c) if the first variable is less than the second variable "The first value is less than the second"

Use document.write() to display the messages

Upload to your web site when completed.  Place a link to this file from your student home page.

If you get stuck see an example here:  http://www.imed2351.com/javascript/hw-conditionals-sol.htm

BONUS:  Instead of using separate if() statements for each section, create a user-defined function and pass the values are arguments.
You can name the function compareValues() for example.

<script>
	function compareValues(val1, val2) {
		if (val1 == val2) {
			return "The values are equal";
		}
		else if (val1 > val2) {
			return "The first value is greater than the second";
		}
		else {
			return "The second value is greater than the first";
		}
	};
