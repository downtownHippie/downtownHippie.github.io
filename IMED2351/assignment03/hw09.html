INSTRUCTIONS:

Mommy can I have some Candy?

Write JavaScript code to do the following:

1.  Pretend JavaScript is a two year old.  It keeps asking the same question over and over again until it gets the answer it wants.

2.  Create a prompt() box that asks the question "Mommy can I have some Candy?"

3.  Continue displaying the prompt() box until the answer is "yes".

4.  If the answer is "yes" then update the <h1> tag to say "Thank you Mommy!"

5.  If the answer is not "yes" then keep displaying the prompt() asking the same question...forever.

HINT:  You must keep displaying the prompt until the expected response is entered.  You will need to use a loop.
You will need to determine which loop to use.

This may or may not be hard.
