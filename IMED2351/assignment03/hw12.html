INSTRUCTIONS:

The following JavaScript code is incomplete.  You must complete it.

1.  When the user enters a an age you must display a message.

2.  If the age entered is 18 or above then display in the <p> tag "You are old enough to vote! You are XX years old", where XX is the age they entered.

3.  If the age entered is less than 18, then display in the <p> tag You are not old enough to vote.  You must be YY", where YY is the voteAge.


HINT: Another homework assignment has similar logic for this.

4.  Create the conditional logic needed to provide response in the <p> tag with the id=response.

5.  Add your JavaScript code where it says "Place conditional logic here"

NOTE:  The event logic works correctly.  You will need to use if() statement.
