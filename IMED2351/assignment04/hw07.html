INSTRUCTIONS:

Display numbers from user.

Write JavaScript code to do the following:

1.  Create two prompt() boxes to ask for two numbers.

2.  The first number must be greater than 0.  Display an error (use alert("Number must be greater than 0")) if the number is not greater than 0.

3.  The second number must be greater than 1.  Display an error (use alert("Number must be greater than 1")) if the number is not greater than 1.

HINT:  You can end any further processing after either error.

4.  When you have the two numbers that meet the criteria above use a loop (either for() or while()) to display the count of the numbers from First Number to Second Number.
For example if the user enters 10 for the first number and 20 for the second number, display 10, 11, 12, 13, 14...etc.

You will need to create the necessary variables needed to keep track of the values.
You may use document.write() to output the results from the loop.

This may be hard.
