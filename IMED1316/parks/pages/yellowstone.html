				<p>Yellowstone is not just a wonderland in its own right; this park is home to the world's largest collection of geysers, including the famous attraction, Old Faithful. They are the main reason the park was established in 1872 as America's first national park&#8211;an idea that spread worldwide. A mountain wildland, home to grizzly bears, wolves, and herds of bison and elk, the park is the core of one of the last, nearly intact, natural ecosystems in the Earth's temperate zone.</p>
