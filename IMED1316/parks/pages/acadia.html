				<p>Exploring Acadia is like walking through a geology textbook with chapters that include all three rock types, plate tectonics, volcanism, glaciations, and shoreline erosion. The flora and fauna of Acadia National Park and surrounding waters comprise a rich mix of species significant in their biodiversity, and the cultural resources of Acadia National Park document human activities that span 5,000 years. Today, over two million visitors each year seek Acadia's gifts, either by trail, boat, bicycle, vehicle, or through quiet contemplation.</p>
